A Django templatetag library for using Media instances in templates.

If your template expects certain Javascript or CSS files, it can declare that
using these tags, which create Media instances.

See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/media/#media-objects

There are two tags template_js and template_css . Their syntax is:

{% media_js "Javascript filename" in template_variable_name %}

This will add the javascript file given to a Media instance in the given
context variable name. If that context variable doesn't exist, it's added and
set to a new Media instance with just that javascript file.

{% media_css "CSS media" "CSS filename" in template_variable_name %}

Ditto above, but for CSS.
